<h1>About</h1>
<img id="my-picture" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/me(light).png') }}" />
<p>I'm, I'm <b>Nicholas</b>. I'm from Paris, but raised in english my whole life. I've also lived in San Francisco and am going back soon.
I do a lot of different things.  </br></br>
I'm a developer, trained as a french engineer (that means lots and lots of theoretical math and physics, without computers). I write mostly <b>python</b>.
</br></br>
I'm passionate about technology, entrepreneurship, math, innovation, and <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/welcome-to-the-internet.jpg') }}">the internet</a>.
</p>

<h2>Engineering</h2>
<p>
I went to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Paris/What-is-MINES-ParisTech-formerly-%C3%89cole-des-Mines-de-Paris">Mines ParisTech</a>, for a degree in general engineering. I specialized in entrepreneurship and computer science.</br></br>
I've always been in love with math and computers, so ending up where I am was always kind of a no brainer.

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
I believe music has changed my life and the ones of many others.</br></br> 
I played classical piano for 12 years, but now I am mainly on the
passive listener side. I mainly listen to classical, jazz, deep house, minimal, hip hop.

<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
I'm an amateur photographer, mostly I take pictures of things that don't move, capturing people is still much too hard for me! 
</br></br>
I shoot with very little regularity, but you can find some of my stuff on <a href="http://500px.com/nichochar/">500px</a>

<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>
2 years ago, I discovered chess, and I can't stop playing since. I'm far from being a grand master, but if you want to
play I'm always down, just send me a request on <a href="http://www.chess.com/members/view/nichochar">my chess.com</a> account.
</p>

<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>
I play basketball, tennis, and I run a little. Nothing serious, but I like the endorphines.
